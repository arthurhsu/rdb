      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
      The IndexedDB API lacks query capabilities and requires the users to
      write their own query layer. Several attempts of generic relational query
      layer has been attempted, however, the following areas are really hard
      or impossible to be efficiently done in JavaScript:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Memory management: query engine cannot efficiently cache/release a
          loaded object.</li>
        <li>Schema update: IndexedDB allows altering database structure only
          during connection, which is far more restrictive than necessary.</li>
        <li>Storage management: there is not a way to identify or limit the size
          occupied by data on storage.</li>
        <li>Cross process: there is not a way to receive notification when
          database is changed by other connection. Furthermore, users only care
          about the data they care, where a change notification on the database
          scope will not help.</li>
        <li>Indexing bottleneck: implementing complex index data structures
          suffers from boxing/unboxing/garbage collection in JavaScript. Also,
          B-Tree is not necessary a proper solution for all usages.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>As a result, this document defines APIs for a database of tables
      holding rows, each row represents a tuple of data. These APIs provide
      query capabilities that are comparable to a subset of SQL-03 standard.</p>
