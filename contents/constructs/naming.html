  <h2>Naming Rules</h2>
  <p>All names used in the relational database are case sensitive, and they
  must satisfy following rules:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>A name must pass the following check:
        <code>/^[A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9_]*$/.test(name)</code>
    </li>
    <li>A name must not conflict with fields defined in
        <code>Object.prototype</code>
    </li>
  </ul>
