    <p>A database's origin is the same as the origin of the document or worker.
    Each origin has an associated set of database.</p>

    <p class="note">The database origin is not affected by changes to
    <code>document.domain</code>.</p>

    <p>Each origin has an associated set of databases. A database comprises one
    or more tables which hold the data stored in the database.</p>

    <p>Every database has a <em>name</em> which identifies it within a specific
    origin. The name can be any string value, except empty string, and stays
    constant for the lifetime of the database.</p>

    <p>Each database also has a version number for reference only. When a
    database is first created, its version is 0.</p>

    <p class="note">Implementations must support all names. If an implementation
    uses a storage mechanism which can't handle arbitrary database names, the
    implementation must use an escaping mechanism or something similar to map
    the provided name to a name that it can handle.</p>

    <p>Databases has a <em>delete pending</em> flag which is used during
    deletion. When a database is requested to be deleted the flag is set to true
    and all attempts at opening the database are stalled until database is
    deleted.</p>

    <p>The act of opening a database creates a <em>connection</em>. There may be
    multiple connections to a given database at any given time. Each connection
    has a <em>closePending</em> flag which initially is set to false.</p>

    <p>When a connection is initially created it is in opened state. The
    connection can be closed through several means. If the connection is garbage
    collected or execution context where the connection is created is destroyed
    (for example due to the user navigating away from that page), the connection
    is closed. The connection can also be closed explicitly using the steps for
    closing a database connection. When the connection is closed the
    closePending flag is always set to true if it hasn't already been. All
    uncommitted transactions will be cancelled if their associated connections
    are marked close pending.</p>

    <p>Every database contains a <em>schema</em> that defines data types,
    referential integrity enforcement, and indices for the stored data.</p>

    <p>Users can create observers associated with a given database. Each
    observer consists a select query. When the results of that select query
    change, the observer will be triggered.</p>

    <p>The <code>IDatabaseConnection</code> interface represents a connection to
    a database.</p>
