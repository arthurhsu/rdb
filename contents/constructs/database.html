  <h2>Database</h2>
  <p>A database's origin is the same as the origin of the document or worker.
  Each origin has an associated set of database.</p>

  <p class="note">The database origin is not affected by changes to
  <code>document.domain</code>.</p>

  <p>Each origin has an associated set of databases. A database comprises one
  or more tables which hold the data stored in the database.</p>

  <p>Every database has a <em>name</em> which identifies it within a specific
  origin. The name must satisfy the Naming Rules, and stay constant for the
  lifetime of the database.</p>

  <p>Each database also has a version number for reference only. When a
  database is first created, its version is 0.</p>

  <p class="note">Implementations must support all names. If an implementation
  uses a storage mechanism which can't handle arbitrary database names, the
  implementation must use an escaping mechanism or something similar to map
  the provided name to a name that it can handle.</p>

  <p>Databases has a <em>delete pending</em> flag which is used during
  deletion. When a database is requested to be deleted the flag is set to true
  and all attempts at opening the database are stalled until database is
  deleted.</p>

  <p>The act of opening a database creates a <em>connection</em>. There may be
  multiple connections to a given database at any given time. Each connection
  has a <em>closePending</em> flag which initially is set to false.</p>

  <p>When a connection is initially created it is in opened state. The
  connection can be closed through several means. If the connection is garbage
  collected or execution context where the connection is created is destroyed
  (for example due to the user navigating away from that page), the connection
  is closed. The connection can also be closed explicitly using the steps for
  closing a database connection. When the connection is closed the
  closePending flag is always set to true if it hasn't already been. All
  uncommitted transactions will be canceled if their associated connections
  are marked close pending.</p>

  <p>Every database contains zero or more <em>tables</em> to store data. A
  table contains zero or more <em>rows</em>. A row is also known as a record or
  a tuple, which represents a single structured data item in a table. A row
  consists zero or more <em>columns</em>, each with predefined data types.
  A database can also contain <em>indices</em>. An index is a data structure
  that enables fast look up and/or enforces data integrity.</p>

  <p>Every database has a predefined layout of the data structures persisted,
  which is referred as <em>schema</em> throughout this document. A database
  schema consists of a list of table schema. Each table schema describes the
  structures of the rows stored within it, which is also referred as 
  <em>column definitions</em>. A table schema also describes
  <em>constraints</em> and <em>index</em> structures for that table.</p>

  <p>Users can create observers associated with a given database. Each
  observer consists a select query. When the results of that select query
  change, the observer will be triggered.</p>

  <p>The <code>IDatabaseConnection</code> interface represents a connection to
  a database.</p>
