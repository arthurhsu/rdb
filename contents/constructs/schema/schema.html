  <h2>Schema</h2>
  <p>The concept of relational database is to have a predefined layout of the
  data structures persisted, which is referred as schema throughout this
  document. A database schema consists of a list of table schemas. Each table
  schema has a list of column definitions, constraints, and index
  specifications for that table.</p>
