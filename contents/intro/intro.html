  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>Relational data manipulation for the web apps has been in a difficult
  state for years. WebSQL has quite a few problems with itself and hence
  deprecated. The poised substitute, IndexedDB, is actually an object database.
  In this document, an easy-to-use APIs are defined to promote readable,
  maintainable, and performance code for apps needing relational data.</p>
  
  <p>Why a new standard is proposed instead of modifying existing IndexedDB?
  There are some very good reasons of doing so.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Making IndexedDB more bloated with the features that object databases
    don't need simply makes no sense.</li>

    <li>At the time of drafting this spec, most browsers carry a C++ relational
    database implementation without exposing it.</li>

    <li>Fundamentally the algorithms behind an object database and a relational
    database are different. Shoehorning a relational query layer on top of
    IndexedDB creates unnecessary complexity. Users are either forced to write
    their own domain-specific query engine, or to include a large JS library
    (e.g. Lovefield).</li>

    <li>IndexedDB assumes single-level B-Tree index and object store structure
    are good enough, which is not true for relational data manipulation.</li>

    <li>JavaScript lacks many fundamental support needed by relational query
    engine, especially for memory management and storage management.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The APIs proposed in this document are designed for small-scale relational
  data manipulation. The following example shows how to open a database.</p>
  <pre class="example highlight">
    {{include: open.js}}
  </pre>
  <p>Once the database is opened, queries can be performed.</p>
  <pre class="example highlight">
    {{include: scud.js}}
  </pre>
