  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
  The IndexedDB API lacks query capabilities and requires the users to
  write their own query layer. Several attempts of generic relational query
  layer has been made, however, the following areas are really hard or
  impossible to be efficiently done in JavaScript:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Memory management: query engine cannot efficiently cache/release a
      loaded object.</li>
    <li>Schema update: IndexedDB allows altering database structure only
      during connection, which is far more restrictive than necessary.</li>
    <li>Storage management: there is not a way to identify or limit the size
      occupied by data on storage.</li>
    <li>Cross process: there is not a way to receive notification when
      database is changed by other connection. Furthermore, users only care
      about the data matters to them, which is not equivalent to change
      notification on the database scope.</li>
    <li>Indexing bottleneck: implementing complex index data structures
      suffers from boxing/unboxing/garbage collection in JavaScript. Also,
      B-Tree is not necessary a proper solution for all usages.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
  As a result, this document proposes a small-scale relational database
  that can be used by web applications.
  </p>
  <p>The following example shows how to open a database.</p>
  <pre class="example highlight">
    {{include: open.js}}
  </pre>
  <p>Once the database is opened, queries can be performed.</p>
  <pre class="example highlight">
    {{include: scud.js}}
  </pre>
