  <h2>Naming Rules</h2>
  <p>Names, also known as identifiers, are used to identify entities in schema,
  i.e. database, table, column, index, and constraint. All names used in the
  database schema MUST abide the following rules:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Names are case sensitive</li>
    <li>A name MUST pass the following check:
        <code>/^[A-Za-z][A-Za-z0-9_]*$/.test(name)</code>
    </li>
    <li>A name MUST NOT conflict with properties and methods defined in
        <code>Object.prototype</code> and <a>ITable</a>.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p class="note">Unlike SQL, names in RDB are case-sensitive.</p>
