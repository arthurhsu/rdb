    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>This section is non-normative.</p>

    <p>Schema defines the storage structure of a relational database. A schema
    has a name. The origin of the page and the schema name together uniquely
    identify a database instance.</p>

    <p>A schema has a referential version number associated with it. Version
    number is an integer greater than zero and can be freely assigned. It has no
    effect on identifying a database. It is provided for the convenience of
    developers to version their schema without extra table.</p>

    <p>A schema is structured in a hierachical way. A database contains one or
    more tables. A table contains one or more columns, zero or more indices, and
    zero or more constraints. The collection of columns in a table defines the
    data carried by a row, which is the fundamental unit of data storage in
    relational database. The indices hint the database engine to build index
    structures so that subsequent queries can be acclerated. Index definitions
    may not be honored if the database engine determined that they are not
    necessary. The constraints define the relations of data and ensures data
    integrity.</p>

    <p>The database schema can be described in JSON format or via builder
    pattern APIs. Schema can be changed through schema queries within any
    <code>readwrite</code> transactions. The JSON format and related APIs are
    described in the following sections.</p>
