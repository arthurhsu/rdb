    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>A schema defines the storage structure of a relational database.
    A schema MUST have a name. The origin of the page and the schema name
    together uniquely identify a database instance during runtime.</p>

    <p>A schema has a referential version number associated with it. Version
    number is an integer greater than zero and can be freely assigned. It has
    no effect on identifying a database. It is provided for the convenience of
    developers to version their schema without extra table.</p>

    <p>A schema is structured in a hierachical way. A database schema contains
    one or more tables. A table contains one or more columns, zero or more
    indices, and zero or more constraints. The collection of columns in a table
    defines the fields carried by a row, which is the fundamental unit of data
    storage in relational database. Each column consists a name and an
    associated data type. The indices hint the database engine to build index
    structures so that subsequent queries can be acclerated. Index definitions
    MAY be honored if the database engine determined that they are necessary.
    The constraints define the relations of rows and ensures data integrity,
    and MUST be honored.</p>

    <p>The database schema is constructed via builder pattern APIs. Schema can
    be changed through schema queries within any <code>readwrite</code>
    transactions.</p>
