  <h2>Ordering</h2>
  <p>There are two sorting orders defined in the <a><dfn>Order</dfn></a>
  enum:</p>
  <pre class="idl">
    enum Order {
      "asc",
      "desc"
    };
  </pre>
  <p>The <dfn data-dfn-for="Order">asc</dfn> represents ascending sorting order,
  and is the default sorting order if none is provided. The
  <dfn data-dfn-for="Order">desc</dfn> represents descending sorting order.</p>

  <p>Ascending sort order is the natural sort order, which means that if two
  fields are ordered as <code>a, b</code>, then <code>(a <= b) === true</code>.
  Since <code>blob</code> and <code>object</code> types are not
  <a>indexable</a>, they cannot be compared and thus the orders have no effect
  for these two types.</p>
