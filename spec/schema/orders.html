  <h2>Orders</h2>
  <p>There are two sorting orders defined in the following enum:</p>
  <pre class="idl">
    enum Order {
      // Represents ascending sort order (Default).
      "asc",

      // Represents descending sort order.
      "desc"
    };
  </pre>
  <p>Ascending sort order is the natural sort order, which means that if two
  fields are ordered as <code>a, b</code>, then <code>(a <= b) === true</code>.
  Since <code>blob</code> and <code>object</code> types are not
  <a>indexable</a>, they cannot be compared and thus the orders have no effect
  for these two types.</p>
