  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>Relational data manipulation for web apps has been in a difficult
  state for years. WebSQL has quite a few problems and is hence justifiably
  deprecated. IndexedDB, on the other hand, is an object database, not a
  relational database. In this document, we define a series of easy-to-use APIs
  that promote readable, maintainable, and performant code for apps needing
  relational data.</p>

  <p>The APIs proposed in this document are designed for small-scale relational
  data manipulation. The following example shows how to open a database.</p>
  <pre class="example highlight">
    {{include: ../example/open.js}}
  </pre>
  <p>Once a connection to the database has been established, queries can be
    performed.
  </p>
  <pre class="example highlight">
    {{include: ../example/scud.js}}
  </pre>

  <p>The proposed spec defines the behaviors of a database. A database consists
  of two parts: the storage and the query engine. Data is stored in the storage
  as rows, each row is a tuple of values, and the types of values are defined as
  columns. Same class of rows are grouped together as a table. A database schema
  is used to define columns inside tables, and the relations among tables.
  The query engine is responsible for reading and writing rows from the storage,
  enforcing relations defined in the schema, and providing various functions to
  manipulate data (adding, removing, updating rows or tables).</p>
