  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>Relational data manipulation for web apps has been in a difficult
  state for years. WebSQL has quite a few problems and is hence
  deprecated. IndexedDB, on the other hand, is an object database. In this
  document, we define a series of easy-to-use APIs that promote readable,
  maintainable, and performant code for apps needing relational data.</p>

  <p>The APIs proposed in this document are designed for small-scale relational
  data manipulation. The following example shows how to open a database.</p>
  <pre class="example highlight">
    {{include: open.js}}
  </pre>
  <p>Once the database is opened, queries can be performed.</p>
  <pre class="example highlight">
    {{include: scud.js}}
  </pre>

  <p>The proposed spec defines the behaviors of a database. A database consists
  of two parts: storage and query engine. Data is stored in the storage as
  rows, each row is a tuple of values, and the types of values are defined as
  columns. Same class of rows are grouped together as a table. The database
  has a concept named schema to define columns inside tables, and the relations
  among rows. Query engine is responsible for reading and writing rows from the
  storage, enforcing relations defined in the schema, and providing various
  functions to manipulate how the rows are read and written.</p>
