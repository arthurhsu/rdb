  <h2>Inner Join</h2>
  <p>Inner joins create a new result table by combining column values of two
  tables involved in the join based upon the predicate given as join
  condition. Inner joins MAY be specified either implicitly through search
  conditions, or explicitly via <code>innerJoin()</code>. The following
  example demonstrates two equivalent inner join syntaxes:</p>
  <pre class="example highlight">
  {{include: inner_join.js}}
  </pre>

  <p>The results of inner join MUST be equivalent to the outcome of the
  following algorithm:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Let T<sub>1</sub> and T<sub>2</sub> denote tables involved in the
      inner join.</li>
    <li>Let C denotes the <a href="#cartesian-product">Cartesian product</a>
    of T<sub>1</sub> and T<sub>2</sub>.</li>
    <li>For each row in C, evaluate the predicate provided as join
    condition. Return the rows whose evaluation is true.</li>
  </ol>
  <p class="note">Conceptually the inner join will create a new table.
  Implementation MAY NOT create actual table as long as the returned results
  are correct.</p>
