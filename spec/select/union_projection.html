  <h2>Union Projection</h2>
  <p>Union projection is different from joins. It just attempts to combine the
  projected results into rows using the following algorithm:</p>
  <ol type="1">
    <li>For any two different queries in union queries, check if their
    projected columns are compatible.
    <ol type="A">
      <li>Let Q<sub>x</sub> and Q<sub>y</sub> denote the queries to be
      checked.</li>
      <li>For any column C in Q<sub>x</sub>, it MUST satisfy one of the
      following condition:
      <ol type="i">
        <li>No column in Q<sub>y</sub> has the same name, and C is
        nullable.</li>
        <li>Another column C' in Q<sub>y</sub> has the same name or alias as C,
        and the column has exactly the same data type.</li>
      </ol>
      Otherwise a <a>TypeError</a> will be thrown.</li>
    </ol></li>
    <li>Union all qualified columns as new projection list, execute the
      queries. Query engine CAN decide the execution orders. Final projected
      rows MUST be generated in the order of union queries, i.e. the rows from
      <code>union()</code> query first, then in the order of the parameters
      inside <code>union()</code>.</li>
  </ol>
