  <h2>Insert Query</h2>
  <p>Insert queries are used to insert rows into tables. There are two
  variations of insert queries: <code>insert</code> and
  <code>insertOrReplace</code>. Both variations support the following
  interface:</p>

  <pre class="idl">
    interface IInsertQuery : IQuery {
      IInsertQuery into(ITable table);
      IInsertQuery values((object or sequence< object > or IBindableValue) rows);
    };
  </pre>
  <dl class="methods">
    <dt><code>IInsertQuery into(ITable table);</code></dt>
    <dd>Specifies the target table to insert rows into. For
    <code>insertOrReplace</code>, the <code>table</code> MUST have a primary
    key, otherwise <a>IntegrityError</a> will be thrown.</dd>
    <dt><code>IInsertQuery values((object or sequence< object > or IBindableValue) rows);</code></dt>
    <dd>Supplies the row(s) to be inserted. When given an <code>object</code>
    as parameter, or the bindable value resolved as an object, the object will
    act as a single row; otherwise, each element in the given array is treated
    as an individual row.</dd>
  </dl>
  <p>All methods of <a>IInsertQuery</a> returns the calling
  <code>IInsertQuery</code> object for cascade builder pattern. The methods MUST
  be called once and only once per query before its execution, otherwise
  <a>SyntaxError</a> MUST be raised.</p>

  <p>If an <a>IInsertQuery</a> object is created from <code>insert</code>,
  and a row with duplicated primary key is given, <a>ConstraintError</a>
  MUST be thrown if query engine detected integrity violation. On the other
  hand, if the <a>IInsertQuery</a> object is from <code>insertOrReplace</code>,
  the offended row MUST be silently replaced by the new row provided,
  effectively as removing the offended row and insert the offending row.</p>

  <p>If any of the inserted row causes integrity violation other than primary
  key, a <a>ConstraintError</a> MUST be thrown regardless.</p>

  <p>If any of the given rows does not exactly match the table schema of the
  table specified, <a>DataError</a> MUST be raised. Exact match means that each
  column specified in the table schema MUST appear as a property of any
  object provided as row.</a>

  <p class="note"><a>IBindableValue</a> can also resolve as an array of
  objects to provide multiple rows in one call.</p>
