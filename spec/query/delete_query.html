  <h2>Delete Query</h2>
  <p>Delete queries are used to delete rows in a table. The rows to be deleted
  are specified via <a href="#search-condition">Search Condition</a>. If the
  search condition is not provided, all rows in the table specified by
  <code>from()</code> will be deleted. The delete query implements the
  <dfn>IDeleteQuery</dfn> interface:</p>

  <pre class="idl">
    interface IDeleteQuery : IQuery {
      IDeleteQuery from(ITable table);
      IDeleteQuery where(ILogicalPredicate searchCondition);
    };
  </pre>
  <dl class="methods">
    <dt><code>IDeleteQuery
    <dfn data-dfn-for="IDeleteQuery">from</dfn>(ITable table);</code></dt>
    <dd>Specifies the target table to delete rows from. This method MUST be
    called before execution, or <a>SyntaxError</a> will be thrown.</dd>
    <dt><code>IDeleteQuery
    <dfn data-dfn-for="IDeleteQuery">where</dfn>(ILogicalPredicate searchCondition);</code></dt>
    <dd>Specifies the search condition for filtering rows.</dd>
  </dl>
  <p>All methods of <a>IDeleteQuery</a> returns the calling
  <code>IDeleteQuery</code> object for cascade builder pattern. The methods can
  only be called once per query, otherwise <a>SyntaxError</a> MUST be raised.
  </p>

  <p>If the table is empty, or the search condition returns no matching rows,
  the delete query will finish successfully without doing anything. If deleting
  rows cause data integrity violation (for example, deleting a row that is
  referred in a foreign key), a <a>ConstraintError</a> MUST be raised.</p>
