  <h2>Transaction</h2>
  <p>A <dfn>transaction</dfn> is an atomic unit of reading and writing data in
  a database. The term atomic means it is guaranteed that all operations inside
  this transaction to be committed as a whole, or none get committed.
  A committed transaction guarantees all data being written to storage.
  The operations inside a transaction are referred as queries. A
  <dfn>query</dfn> means an interaction with the database: data retrieval,
  data persistence, or change of schema.</p>

  <p>Transaction execution behavior is modeled as the following:</p>

  <pre class="idl">
    typedef (void or sequence< object >) TransactionResults;

    interface IExecutionContext {
      Promise< TransactionResults > commit();
      Promise< void > rollback();
    };
  </pre>
  <dl class="methods">
    <dt><code>Promise< TransactionResults > commit();</code></dt>
    <dd>Runs <a href="#commit-algorithm">commit algorithm</a>.</dd>
    <dt><code>Promise< void > rollback();</code></dt>
    <dd>Runs <a href="#rollback-algorithm">rollback algorithm</a>.</dd>
  </dl>

  <p>All transactions are associated with a database connection, which is the
  <a>connection</a> that the transaction is created within. A transaction has
  a predetermined <em>mode</em> to indicate what access this transaction is
  asking for. The mode is set when the transaction is created and remains fixed
  for the life of the transaction. There are two transaction modes:</p>

  <pre class="idl">
    enum TransactionMode {
      // Transaction intends to read data/schema only.
      "readonly",

      // Transaction intends to read/write data and/or read/change schema.
      "readwrite"
    };
  </pre>

  <p>A transaction has a <dfn>scope</dfn> that determines the rows affected by
  this transaction. The scope is automatically calculated. The scope of a
  transaction MAY dynamically change during the lifetime of the transaction.
  </p>

  <p>A transaction can be created explicitly or implicitly. An explicit
  transaction is created directly from
  <code>IDatabaseConnection.createTransaction()</code>. An implicit transaction
  is created when the <a href="#commit-algorithm">commit algorithm</a> needs
  one. The explicit transaction is modeled as following:</p>

  <pre class="idl">
    interface ITransaction : IExecutionContext {
      Promise< void > begin();
      Promise< TransactionResults > exec(sequence< IExecutionContext > queries);
      Promise< TransactionResults > attach(IExecutionContext query);
    };
  </pre>
  <dl class="methods">
    <dt><code>Promise< void > begin();</code></dt>
    <dd>Starts <em>sequence mode</em> execution. The transaction will be kept
    alive until <code>commit()</code> or <code>rollback()</code> of this
    transaction is triggered, or the transaction is timed out by implementation
    (which the implementation MUST throw <a>TimoutError</a> and reject any
    further calls on this transaction object).</dd>
    <dt><code>Promise< TransactionResults > exec(sequence< IExecutionContext > queries);</code></dt>
    <dd>Starts <em>batch mode</em> execution and auto-commit.</dd>
    <dt><code>Promise< TransactionResults > attach(IExecutionContext query);</code></dt>
    <dd>Schedules a query to existing <em>sequence mode</em> execution. The
    promise will be resolved with the results when the query is executed.
    The query MUST NOT be an explicit transaction, i.e. <a>ITransaction</a>
    object.</dd>
  </dl>

  <p class="note">This specification does not support nested transactions.</p>

  <p>The lifetime of an explicit transaction is controlled by the user.
  There are two ways to start execution: <em>batch mode</em> and
  <em>sequence mode</em>. In batch mode, an explicit transaction is started
  with <code>exec(queriesArray)</code> and returns
  a result <code>Promise</code>. All queries will be executed sequentially in
  the order received, and the results of last query in the transaction are
  returned in the promise. In sequence mode, user calls <code>begin()</code> to
  start the transaction, calls <code>attach(query)</code> to attach a query to
  the transaction's execution context. The user can call <code>commit()</code>
  to indicate the end of transaction, and a final result <code>Promise</code>
  will be returned; or the user can call <code>rollback()</code> to abort the
  transaction, and all modifications done by previous attached queries will be
  discarded.</p>

  <p>When a transaction is committed or rolled back, it is said to be
  <em>finished</em>. A finished transaction MUST NOT be started nor rolled
  back. If a transaction's connection is lost before transaction being
  finished, the transaction is effectively rolled back and no change will be
  persisted.</p>

    <h2>Commit Algorithm</h2>
    <p>An <a>IExecutionContext</a> can be obtained from <a>ITransaction</a>, or
    other classes such as <a>IQuery</a> or <a>ITableBuilder</a>. The execution
    context from <a>ITransaction</a> is a <em>bound context</em>, which means
    that it has an associated transaction. An execution context from sources
    other than <a>ITransaction</a> is an <em>unbound context</em>, which means
    that it does not have an associated transaction.</p>

    <p>The commit algorithm is described in following steps:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>If the execution context is a bound context, go to step 3.</li>
      <li>If the context can be carried out using <code>readonly</code>
      transaction mode, create a transaction using that mode; otherwise create
      a <code>readwrite</code> transaction. Associate the transaction with the
      execution context.</li>
      <li>If the associated transaction is marked as <em>pending finish</em>,
      throws <a>TransactionStateError</a>.
      <li>Mark the associated transaction as <em>pending finish</em>, which
      will prohibit the transaction from attaching more queries, or calling
      <code>rollback</code>.
      <li>Retrieves the result promise <code>R</code> of the last execution
      context in the associated transaction from query engine.</li>
      <li>If the transaction is already running in sequence mode, returns
      <code>R</code>.</li>
      <li>If the associated transaction is not started, notifies the query
      engine to execute it in batch mode, and returns <code>R</code>.</li>
      <li>When <code>R</code> resolves or rejects, mark transaction as
      <em>finished</em>.</li>
    </ol>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Rollback Algorithm</h2>
    <p>The rollback algorithm is described in following steps:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>If the execution context is an unbound context, returns a resolved
      promise.</li>
      <li>If the associated tranaction is marked as <em>pending finish</em> or
      <em>finished</em>, throws <a>TransactionStateError</a>.</li>
      <li>If the associated transaction is not executed yet, mark the
      transaction as <em>finished</em> and returns a resolved promise.</li>
      <li>Marks the associated transaction as <em>finish pending</em>, and
      notifies query engine to rollback. Returns a promise.</li>
      <li>When the query engine rolled back the transaction, resolve promise;
      otherwise, reject promise with <a>IntegrityError</a>.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Transaction Snapshots</h2>
    <p>A <dfn>snapshot</dfn> of the database is the contents of all rows in the 
    database at the time when the snapshot is taken. At any given time, query
    engine MUST guarantee only one connection can create snapshot on a given 
    scope. Conceptually, each transaction operates on its own snapshot of
    database, and the snapshot is taken at the beginning of transaction. The
    beginning of transaction is determined by either calling
    <a>ITransaction.begin</a> or <a>ITransaction.exec</a> for explicit
    transactions, or <a>IExecutionContext.commit</a> for implicit
    transactions.</p>

    <p>All changes performed by queries inside the transaction will only be
    effective on that snapshot. The end of transaction is determined by
    resolution or rejection of the <code>Promise</code> returned from
    <a>ITransaction.exec</a> or <a>IExecutionContext.commit</a>. If the
    transaction is committed, i.e. resolution of <code>Promise</code>, the
    database MUST be updated to that snapshot. If the transaction is rolled
    back, i.e. rejection of <code>Promise</code>, the snapshot is discarded.</p>

    <p>The final data persisted on database is determined by the last
    transaction snapshot committed by the query engine. The transaction
    snapshots MAY come from other sessions other than current session.
    The query engine MUST guarantee only one snapshot can be persisted at a
    given time if there were multiple snapshots on a given scope. If there were
    multiple snapshots on a given scope, and one of them is persisted while
    the others are open, all the opened snapshots will be invalidated and their
    associated transactions must be rolled back.</p>

    <p class="note">It's up to the implementation to determine whether a table
    scope or a row scope to be used in transaction snapshots. The minimum
    requirement for this specification is to support table scope, i.e.
    different transactions MUST be able to operate on different tables
    simultaneously.</p>
