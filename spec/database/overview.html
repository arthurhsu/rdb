  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>A database's origin is the same as the origin of the document or worker.
  Each origin has an associated set of database.</p>

  <p class="note">The database origin is not affected by changes to
  <code>document.domain</code>.</p>

  <p>Each origin has an associated set of databases. A database comprises one
  or more tables which hold the data stored in the database.</p>

  <p>Every database has a predefined layout of the data structures persisted,
  which is referred as <a href="#schema">schema</a>. The <em>database name</em>
  specified in schema identifies the database within a specific origin.
  The name MUST satisfy the <a href="#naming-rules">Naming Rules</a>, and stay
  constant for the lifetime of the database. Each database also has a version
  number for reference only.</p>

  <p>Databases has a <em>delete pending</em> flag which is used during
  deletion. When a database is requested to be deleted the flag is set to true
  and all attempts at opening the database are stalled until database is
  deleted.</p>

  <p>The act of opening a database creates a <dfn>connection</dfn>. There MAY
  be multiple connections to a given database at any given time. Each
  connection has a <em>closePending</em> flag which initially is set to
  false.</p>

  <p>When a connection is initially created it is in opened state. The
  connection can be closed through several means. If the connection is garbage
  collected or execution context where the connection is created is destroyed
  (for example due to the user navigating away from that page), the connection
  is closed. The connection can also be closed explicitly using the steps for
  closing a database connection. When the connection is closed the
  closePending flag is always set to true if it hasn't already been. All
  uncommitted transactions will be canceled if their associated connections
  are marked close pending.</p>

  <p>Users can create observers associated with a given database. Each
  observer consists a select query. When the results of that select query
  change, the observer will be triggered. The change MAY come from other
  connections.</p>
